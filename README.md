QUESTION;

Demonstrate the use of polymorphism in Java. Create an interface “Shape” with a method “calculateArea”. Implement this interface in two classes: “Circle” and “Square”, each providing its own implementation of the “calculateArea” method.


POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA 

This is the task that performs a single action in different ways.

Polymorphism occurs when there is inheritance that is many classes are related. Inheritance is a powerful feature in Java that lets one class acquire the properties and attributes of another class. Polymorphism in Java allows us to use these inherited properties to perform different tasks. Thus, allowing us to achieve the same action in many different ways.

Looking at polymorphism in real life; an individual can have different relationships with different people. A woman can be a mother, a daughter, a sister, and a friend all at the same time this means she performs other behaviors in different situations.

Looking at polymorphism in Java; a superclass named “Shapes” has a method called “calculateArea” the subclasses of “Shapes” can be “Circle” and “Square”. Each subclass has its own way of calculating area. Using inheritance and polymorphism means, the subclasses can use the “calculateArea” method to find the area’s formula for that shape.
